# Advanced-Decision-Making-Predictive-Analytics-Machine-Learning-Project
Comparing categories of machine learning algorithms through decision-making exercises on selected datasets.
 
 This paper aims to explore the process of decision making using Machine Learning algorithms and methodologies. The development is divided into two parts. Firstly, we will compare tree-based algorithms with conditional probability algorithms. Secondly, we will train and compare Machine Learning algorithms to solve a prediction problem of predicting the scribes of the Avalone Bible based on page layout features. The Avila Dataset with 10,430 training samples and 10,437 test samples will be used for this purpose, and Python will be the programming language utilized. This is a supervised learning problem since we already have information on the passages of the Bible written by each scribe. The prediction problem will be approached as a classification problem, and the results of the different algorithms will be analyzed and compared.
